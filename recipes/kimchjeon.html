            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A kimchi pancake is one of the easiest and quickest things to make and is one of Koreans' all time favorite dishes. It's hot, spicy, crispy, a little sweet, sour, and a little salty. It is not only a great snack but also it goes well with rice as a side dish, and is great in lunchboxes in place of plain kimchi.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>½ lb well-fermented napa cabbage kimchi, chopped into small pieces, plus 2 tablespoons of the brine</li>
                <li>3 scallions, chopped</li>
                <li>½ tsp sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ cup water</li>
                <li>4 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the kimchi, kimchi brine, scallions, sugar, flour, and water in a medium bowl and mix well with a spoon</li>
                <li>Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat</li>
                <li>Add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into the pan and spread it with the back of a spoon or a spatula to make a large circle</li>
                <li>Cook until the bottom is golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Carefully turn the pancake over. Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons oil around the edges of the skillet, then lift the pancake with a thin spatula to allow the oil to run underneath and tilt the pan to spread it evenly</li>
                <li>Cook until the bottom of the pancake is light golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Flip it one more time and cook for another minute</li>
                <li>Slide onto a large serving platter and serve immediately</li>
            </ol>
