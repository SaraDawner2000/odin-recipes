            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A kimchi pancake is one of the easiest and quickest things to make and is one of Koreans' all time favorite dishes. It's hot, spicy, crispy, a little sweet, sour, and a little salty. It is not only a great snack but also it goes well with rice as a side dish, and is great in lunchboxes in place of plain kimchi.</p>
