        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lucious and garlicky buttons of heaven! If you never tried making these, you definately should. Though the original recipe is Korean, the ingredients are as simple as it gets -- potatoes, starch, vegetable oil, garlic, spices to taste.</p>
        <P>Once you understand how to make these, you can experiment with different vegetables, starches, cooking times and spices, but the basic principle will always be the same.</P>
